UCSD SIPP Project: Sign Language Recognition for Computer Music Performance

The final project, titled "Sign Language Recognition for Computer Music Performance", blends Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Data Processing within the versatile Python environment. The project concocts an innovative system that translates gestural language, consisting of select American Sign Language (ASL) signs and custom-made gestures, into an intuitive control interface for computer music performance. Capitalizing on the capabilities of OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries, the system deciphers hand gestures from captured images, pinpointing vital hand landmarks. This information feeds into the training of Machine Learning classifiers, enabling real-time recognition of gestures from a video feed to control the computer music performance. By marrying the expressiveness of gestural language with advanced technology, this project not only propels a novel interaction method with music but also exemplifies the potential of creativity in the arts, enhanced by the melding of human expressivity and artificial intelligence advancements.
